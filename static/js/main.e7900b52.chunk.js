Your brand name should be an endless reference point to why your brand exists. Also, editors note; don\u2019t be afraid to stop and start a new brand name out of nowhere. As they also say, if it\u2019s broke, fix it. New ideas come all the time; I often see people too precious with old ideas. Your brand\u2019s name is the most powerful asset that you can have. How does one come to the final choice for their brand name? Using this video, see the multiple steps that you, as a founder, can do to assess and create a brand name that will stand out._\n\n\n### 3 steps to branding \n1. Decide type of name, options described in list below\n2. Decide what you want the name to say, the message behind it, best brand names don\u2019t simply describe but they stand for a big idea and convey emotion (Nike, go pro, Apple, google)\n3. Check that the name is available, expect to create hundreds if not thousands before you find one \n"})})]})})}),Object(i.jsx)(b.a,{children:Object(i.jsx)("div",{children:Object(i.jsxs)(g.Window,{hidden:!c,chrome:!0,height:"auto",width:"500px",padding:"10px",children:[Object(i.jsx)(g.TitleBar,{isFullscreen:t,onCloseClick:function(){return console.log("Close window")},onMinimizeClick:function(){return d(!0)},onMaximizeClick:function(){return o(!0)},onResizeClick:function(){return o(!0)},title:"Name Types",controls:!0}),Object(i.jsx)(w,{children:Object(i.jsx)(u.a,{plugins:[h.a],children:"\n### 7 types of names \n  1.

Paving your own lane. Being a Misfit.  Being a black sheep. Going against the grain. Breaking the mold and challenging the status quo. Highlighting your uniqueness and framing it as the advantage that it is. To be an enigma. To be enigmatic.\n  2. Doing something in new and exciting ways. Leveraging existing ideas as to not re-invent the wheel. But innovating upon them. \n  3. Having grit and being dedicated to making your dreams come true. Proving that what you can accomplish is endless, with persistence, consistency, hard-work and belief in yourself. Turning dreams into things. No idea too big, no concept out of reach or beyond grasp. Everything is possible.\n  4. The ultimate, the greatest, the supreme. The best at what we do. Highly skilled and professional. \n  5. Serendipity, no-brainer, things in alignment, coincidence or the lack there of.  Energies align as omens to show you the path you should take. This plays on trusting your gut and the signs you interpret from the situations you experience.\n  6. Being for the culture. Being about the culture. Giving back to the culture and supporting the community that allows us to exist. Things like community outreach, charity, having a skate team, putting on artists and musicians by promoting them through our platforms and social media outlets.\n  7. Abundance. Acting from a place of abundance and not a place of lack. Trust that the universe will continue to shower you with abundance. Accepting the infinite abundance that the universe has already surrounded you with. Learning to recognize the abundance around you through awareness of the present and gratitude. Generosity and freedom to express ourselves creatively without restriction or limit. \n  8. Most lit brand the world will ever see. We are going to be making moves and doing things at a level that people can\u2019t imagine. It will disrupt the ideas of what a brand is capable of, or what it means\n  9. Skate fast eat ass. Sk8 or die. Skateboarding culture needs to be at the core of our ethos. That wildly creative and rebellious edge, that creates progress and a shattering of previously imagined limits. EDGY AND ON ONE WITH HUUUGE BALLS.\n  10. Hip hop culture. That 90s boom bap, streetwear spawning, graffiti, street art hip hop culture.\n  11. Metal culture. Heavy metal culture. (Look at Alejandro and Steve) LMAO\n  12. Informative. Conveying a message and supporting a stance that promotes the progression of the human race, equality and forward thinking. Being impactful in the way we convey that message. Through dramatic emotional expression\n  13. Being transparent. Not trying to hide or conceal everything. Putting everything out on the table because we have nothing to hide.\n  14. Ethical. Self explanatory.\n  15. Sustainability needs to be at the core of our practices and systems to guarantee the continued success of this organization.\n  "})})]})})}),Object(i.jsx)(b.a,{children:Object(i.jsx)("div",{children:Object(i.jsxs)(g.Window,{hidden:!c,chrome:!0,height:"auto",width:"600px",padding:"10px",children:[Object(i.jsx)(g.TitleBar,{isFullscreen:t,onCloseClick:function(){return console.log("Close window")},onMinimizeClick:function(){return d(!0)},onMaximizeClick:function(){return o(!0)},onResizeClick:function(){return o(!0)},title:"Stream of Consciousness",controls:!0}),Object(i.jsx)(w,{children:Object(i.jsx)(u.a,{plugins:[h.a],children:"\n  ### Stream of conscious about meaning behind name: \n  I think something we all want this brand to represent is our own energies.

To leverage our collective uniqueness, to allow us to \u2018todos juntos\u2019 create something the world has never seen. It\u2019s value immediately proven by the vision, skillsets and passion each of us bring to the table. That very thing that makes this artistic venture so interesting will also allow it to garner the admiration, following and respect it deserves. We are going to be breaking boundaries and blurring lines between streetwear, art, fashion, music, digital media, technology, literature, cinema and every other medium you can imagine. Disrupting conventional ideas about storytelling, branding, or branding strategy, or what even defines a brand. We will touch every corner of the world with what we create. But it\u2019s going to be a journey, a voyage we all must go on together. I don\u2019t know about all of you, but in my entire life, I\u2019ve never felt like I\u2019ve ever found my place, or fully fit in. I\u2019ve always felt like an outcast or a misfit, a black sheep, a lone wolf. It always used to make me feel really alone and sad but I\u2019ve come to realize that it\u2019s something I can actually leverage into a positive, into an advantage. I want to create a space within this brand for everyone else who feels the same way as I do. To build a community around art, culture, an idea, energy, a movement. A movement that creates change through communicating a message of acceptance, equality, creative expression and love. By being informative and intentional with what we create, touching on key cultural themes and paving the way for the future. This will assure its continued success through building sustainable and efficient systems as the foundation for the brand. To be effective in creating and proposing new ideas, while simultaneously touching on classics to create timeless garments, accessories and supplies for life. Clothes as cool and unique as the person wearing them. Clothes that represent traveling and experiencing the art that is life.
